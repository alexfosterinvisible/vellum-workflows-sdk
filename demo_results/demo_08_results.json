Here's why:\n* Students often think negatives cancel out\n* They subtract instead of adding negatives\n\nCorrect Solution:\n-3 + (-5) = -8\n\u2705 Remember:\n* Adding negatives means going further negative\n* Think of debt: owing $3 plus owing $5 means owing $8\n\n2. Multiplication Sign Rules\n--------------------------\nCommon Mistake:\n-2 \u00d7 -3 = -6\n\u274c Incorrect! Here's what went wrong:\n* Forgetting that negative \u00d7 negative = positive\n* Not applying the sign rule consistently\n\nCorrect Solution:\n-2 \u00d7 -3 = 6\n\u2705 Think about it:\n* First negative reverses -3 to 3\n* Second negative reverses again to 6\n* Two reversals lead to positive\n\n3. Distributing Negatives\n------------------------\nCommon Mistake:\n-(2 + 3) = -2 + 3\n\u274c Watch out! This is incorrect because:\n* The negative must distribute to ALL terms\n* Each term inside parentheses gets negated\n\nCorrect Solution:\n-(2 + 3) = -2 + (-3) = -5\n\u2705 Key points:\n* Distribute the negative to each term\n* Think: opposite of (2 + 3)\n* Check: -5 is opposite of 5\n\n4. Order of Operations\n---------------------\nCommon Mistake:\n-3\u00b2 = 9\n\u274c Hold on! Let's see why this is wrong:\n* The negative isn't part of the base\n* Exponent applies to 3, not -3\n\nCorrect Solution:\n-3\u00b2 = -(3\u00b2) = -9\n\u2705 Remember:\n* Exponents before negation\n* Think: negative of (3 \u00d7 3)\n* Unless parentheses change order: (-3)\u00b2 = 9\n\n5. Subtracting Negatives\n-----------------------\nCommon Mistake:\n5 - (-2) = 3\n\u274c Not quite! Here's the issue:\n* Confusing subtraction of negative\n* Missing the double negative rule\n\nCorrect Solution:\n5 - (-2) = 5 + 2 = 7\n\u2705 Understanding why:\n* Subtracting a negative means adding\n* Like removing a debt is the same as gaining money\n\n\ud83d\udca1 General Tips for Success:\n1. Always check if your answer makes sense\n2. Use number lines for visualization\n3. Think about real-world analogies\n4. Write out steps clearly\n5. Double-check sign rules\n\n\u2705 Practice Strategy:\nWhen you see a negative number:\n1. Pause and identify the operation\n2. Apply sign rules step by step\n3. Verify your answer\n4. Look for patterns in similar problems\n\nWant to test your understanding?\nTry these problems:\n1. What's -4 + (-3)?\n2. Simplify: -2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 (-4)\n3. Solve: -(5 - 2)\n\nRemember:\n* Take your time with signs\n* Write out each step\n* Check your work\n* Practice regularly\n\nNeed more help? Let's explore:\n1. How do you visualize negative numbers?\n2. What real-world examples help you?\n3. Which rules are most challenging?",
