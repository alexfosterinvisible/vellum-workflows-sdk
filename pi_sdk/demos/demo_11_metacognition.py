Understanding Check
-----------------
Before we start, ask yourself:
* What do I know about limits?
* Where have I seen them before?
* What makes them challenging?

Take a moment to write your thoughts...

Core Concept: Limit Approach
--------------------------
Consider: lim(x‚Üí2) (x¬≤ - 4)/(x - 2)

ü§î Self-Questions:
1. What am I seeing?
   * A fraction
   * x approaching 2
   * Similar terms

2. What happens if I try x = 2?
   * Numerator: 2¬≤ - 4 = 0
   * Denominator: 2 - 2 = 0
   * Result: 0/0 (undefined!)

3. Why did this happen?
   * Both parts equal zero
   * Division by zero undefined
   * Need another approach

Strategy Development
------------------
Ask yourself:
* Can I factor the numerator?
* What patterns do I notice?
* Is there a simpler way?

üí≠ Reflection Point:
"The numerator factors to (x+2)(x-2)
The denominator is (x-2)
I see a common factor!"

Solution Path
-----------
Think through:
1. Why can I cancel (x-2)?
2. What happens after canceling?
3. Where could this go wrong?

Result: lim(x‚Üí2) (x+2) = 4

Understanding Deepening
--------------------
Question your process:
* Why did this work?
* What principles did I use?
* Where else could this help?

üîç Learning Check:
Can you explain:
* The initial problem?
* Your solution strategy?
* Why the answer makes sense?

Pattern Recognition
-----------------
Reflect on similar problems:
* When do we get 0/0?
* What strategies help?
* How do we verify limits?

üìù Learning Journal:
Record your insights:
1. What was new today?
2. What connections did you make?
3. What questions remain?

Problem Extension
---------------

* What if x approaches other values?
* What about different functions?
* How do graphs help?

ü§î Metacognitive Prompts:
* How did you approach this?
* What strategies worked best?
* Where did you get stuck?
* How did you overcome challenges?

Strategy Review
-------------
Evaluate your methods:
* What worked well?
* What needed improvement?
* What will you try next time?

üí° Learning Insights:
1. Process awareness
2. Strategy selection
3. Error recognition
4. Solution verification

Next Steps
---------
Plan your learning:
1. What to practice?
2. Which concepts to review?
3. When to seek help?
4. How to apply this?

Remember:
* Question your thinking
* Monitor understanding
* Adjust strategies
* Reflect regularly"""

Strategy Planning Phase
--------------------
Problem: Find the maximum area of a rectangle with perimeter 20 units.

ü§î Pre-Solution Questions:
1. What do I know?
   * Perimeter = 20
   * Need to find area
   * Looking for maximum

2. What strategies could work?
   * Algebra
   * Calculus
   * Graphing

3. How will I choose?
   * Consider complexity
   * Check prerequisites
   * Evaluate efficiency

Strategy Selection
----------------
Monitor your thinking:
* Why choose calculus?
* What makes it suitable?
* How confident are you?

‚úçÔ∏è Strategy Documentation:
"I'll use calculus because:
* Area is a function
* Need to find maximum
* Have derivative tools"

Implementation Monitoring
----------------------
Step 1: Set up equation
* Let width = x
* Length = (20-2x)/2
* Area = x(10-x)

üîç Check Understanding:
* Why did we use 20-2x?
* How does this represent area?
* What are the constraints?

Step 2: Find derivative
A = x(10-x) = 10x - x¬≤
A' = 10 - 2x

üí≠ Strategy Check:
* Why take derivative?
* What does A' tell us?
* How find maximum?

Step 3: Solve A' = 0
10 - 2x = 0
x = 5

üìä Progress Monitor:
* Does this make sense?
* What does x=5 mean?
* Need to verify?

Solution Verification
------------------
Check your work:
1. Dimensions:
   * Width = 5
   * Length = 5
   * Perimeter = 20 ‚úì

2. Area = 25 square units

ü§î Verification Questions:
* Is this reasonable?
* How can we prove it's maximum?
* What about other points?

Strategy Evaluation
-----------------
Assess your approach:
* What worked well?
* Where did you pause?
* What would you change?

* How adapt method?

üìù Strategy Journal:
