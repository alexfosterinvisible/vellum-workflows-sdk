I'll help you execute a command in the terminal. First, let me check what's in your workspace to ensure we run something appropriate.

I see you have a Python project with several directories and files. Let's run a simple command to check the Python version and ensure everything is set up correctly:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
python --version
```

Great! You're running Python 3.10.12 in a virtual environment. Would you like me to:
1. Run some tests (since I see you have pytest files)
2. Check the contents of a specific directory
3. Execute a specific Python file
4. Something else?

Please let me know what you'd like to try next!

Based on the conversation history and file contents, it seems the main tasks have been:

1. Revamping workflow documentation with ASCII art diagrams
2. Improving specific diagrams (top/bottom node, loops)
3. Maintaining code comments and docstrings
4. Working with the CLI tool for prompt exploration and execution

The most recent focus has been on improving the ASCII diagrams for better clarity and accuracy. Would you like me to help with any specific aspect of these tasks or proceed with something else?
